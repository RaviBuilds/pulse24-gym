/**
 * Master pricing/membership data — the single source of truth for Section 06.
 *
 * PURE FRONTEND: there is no CMS, database, API or backend pricing source.
 * Everything the pricing register renders is authored here; the component in
 * components/sections/Membership.tsx consumes this verbatim and never hardcodes
 * a price, name, duration, label or CTA. To re-price the site for a real gym,
 * edit ONLY this file.
 *
 * Do not add discounts, savings, "best value" / "most popular" tags, urgency,
 * scarcity or guarantees — none of those exist in this contract by design.
 *
 * PRICE STATUS
 *   "exact"   -> render the numeric `price`, INR-formatted.
 *   "contact" -> render `contactLabel` ("Consult management") instead of an
 *                amount; `price` may be omitted.
 *   "hidden"  -> the entry does not render publicly at all.
 * Change a single plan's `priceStatus` to move it between these states without
 * touching the component.

/**
 * PULSE 24 FITNESS pricing/membership data — Section 06.
 *
 * DEMONSTRATION PRICING (prospect-demo rules, Cases B/E):
 *
 * docs/Gym-research.md PRICING: `publishes_pricing_publicly: false`; every
 * plan (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, half-year, annual, special
 * training) and the joining fee are NOT_FOUND. The INR 1,500-4,000 monthly
 * figure in the research is general market context, not a Pulse 24 Fitness
 * quote, and is NOT used.
 *
 * The amounts below are therefore the unchanged TEMPLATE DEMO prices
 * (Daily 300, Weekly 1,000, 1 Month 2,500, 3 Months 6,000, 6 Months 10,000,
 * 1 Year 18,000, Personal Coaching 8,000 / month). NONE is a verified
 * Pulse 24 Fitness price — OWNER VERIFICATION REQUIRED before final-client
 * production. All plans stay `priceStatus: "exact"`; no contact-only state is
 * used during prospect-demo mode.
 *
 * The festival offer engine (lib/festival-offers.ts) references the
 * `half-year` and `annual` plan IDs below — do not rename those IDs. No
 * second pricing or offer calculation exists; the engine derives every
 * discounted amount from these prices.
